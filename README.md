This Python program implements a command-line AI chatbot using Googleâ€™s Generative AI (Gemini) API. It configures the API key, initializes the model, and continuously takes user input in a loop. The chatbot processes the input, sends it to the Gemini model, and returns clean, readable responses by removing Markdown formatting with a custom regex-based clean_markdown function. Users can exit anytime by typing "exit" or "quit". This project demonstrates API integration, text processing with regex, and interactive CLI application development in Python.
